<p>Median tenure at a tech company is about 2.5 years, and getting shorter. And while I think that&rsquo;s generally good for employees, who can grow in their careers, compensation, and opportunities by switching roles frequently, it makes the companies themselves weaker.</p>

<p>It took me a long time to realize that the smartest technologists, the people who really know what they&rsquo;re doing, they don&rsquo;t often write in a public facing way where other people can read it. Some of them might&hellip;but most don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And that means that most of the knowledge about what a job <em>is</em>, or how to <em>do</em> a job well, it&rsquo;s not being written down anywhere that you can see it from the outside. I can name, off the top of my head, the best 20 software engineers I&rsquo;ve worked with. None of them have a significant public facing web presence, and while I&rsquo;m sure a few have random blogs floating around in the corner of the internet, I haven&rsquo;t read their stuff, and no one else has either.</p>
<p>Instead the people writing the articles about how to do the job are, often, people not actually doing the job anymore. The best books about how to be a PM are people who <em>used to be</em> PMs, but the best job description for them now is &ldquo;book promotor&rdquo; or &ldquo;author&rdquo; or &ldquo;sales person&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong - they write great books. And I&rsquo;d be the first one to recommend Lean Startup or Cracking the PM Interview or any of the other 100 books in that genre. They&rsquo;re great summaries of general concepts for the work that I do every day. But I don&rsquo;t really have much evidence that the writers were actually good PMs, vs just being in the right place at the right time. Are the people who <em>write</em> about the thing actually good at doing the thing? Or just good writers who have the credibility and knowledge to sell books?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easier with jobs where publicity correlates to being good at your job. Good CEOs are selling their company to employees, investors, and customers. So if you&rsquo;ve heard of a CEO, if they write something you respect, if you listen to them on a podcast, they&rsquo;re actually showing themselves as being good at the job they have.</p>
<p>But engineers, PMs, designers, customer-facing team members, strategy and so on are roles where the best people are not necessarily the best at being public-facing. Indeed, many of them might see writing as, at best, a distraction.</p>
<h3 id="internal-documentation">
  Internal documentation
  <a class="anchor" href="#internal-documentation">#</a>
</h3>
<p>So you would think that instead of writing things down externally, talented technologists write things down <em>internally</em>. Like in a wiki, or in a series of github PRs, or in onboarding documentation that everyone needs to read. And they do.</p>
<p>The best people usually try to pass down their knowledge to newer employees, partly because it feels good to teach, but mostly because that knowledge was earned with blood and sweat and why not just tell people the knowledge instead of forcing them to figure it out from first principles or re-experience the same pain?</p>
<p>Except from the other side, new employees don&rsquo;t have time to read all the crap that was written down before they joined a company. Few people even bother to look. I certainly didn&rsquo;t when I joined Benchling - there was 6 years of documents floating around and I did what any rational person would do: I hunted and pecked for what I thought was useful, and left the rest. I didn&rsquo;t do that good of a job because I didn&rsquo;t know what to hunt and peck for.</p>
<p>It was only when I did a cursory search of a vague concept, like a vocabulary term a customer used once that sounded weird or interesting, that I find reams of documents about how that term is just the beginning of a whole other plane of existence, something that would expand our TAM by 10x, a product that would save the world!</p>
<p>And then I have to wonder to myself - am I the only idiot who didn&rsquo;t know about all of this? And I ask around, and the veterans agree that yeah we&rsquo;ve known about that for a while, except there are fewer veterans around who remember that far back, because median tenure in this industry is so short. And even if tenure was better, people are people, they forget things. How much do you remember from 5 years ago?</p>
<p>We treat companies like these ships of theseuses, where we can replace the boards (rotten or not) and carry on sailing. But some of the boards actually had, written in people&rsquo;s memories or in long forgotten Quip documents and Zoom recordings, all sorts of knowledge about sea monsters and where the buried treasure on that island once was.</p>
<p>And we can&rsquo;t go back and find all that knowledge 1) because we don&rsquo;t know which documents in our internal system are valuable and which ones were the equivalent of Plato&rsquo;s allegory of the cave and 2) because the people who do know either are busy or don&rsquo;t remember or their slack is deactivated.</p>
<h3 id="why-dont-people-talk-to-their-predecessors">
  Why don&rsquo;t people talk to their predecessors?
  <a class="anchor" href="#why-dont-people-talk-to-their-predecessors">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The most striking thing that I notice about this sort of missing knowledge is that people don&rsquo;t really realize the things they don&rsquo;t know. I think intellectually, they realize that it is possible to have knowledge gaps, but pleading ignorance and going to someone else and asking them to fill you in, that&rsquo;s sort of an embarrassing, humble thing to do, and I don&rsquo;t see it as much as I&rsquo;d like to. I am as guilty of this as anyone.</p>
<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re new in a job here. You would think that the first thing you would do is find the person who used to have that job, and ask them to give you as much knowledge as possible. Because there&rsquo;s no way you would possibly know as much about <em>this</em> job as the person who just had it, right?</p>
<p>But apart for a few exceptional cases (for example, when someone moves from IC to manager and backfill hires the IC to replace them) this doesn&rsquo;t really happen. If the former person moved to a different role at Benchling, context and knowledge share is limited to, at best, a couple of 1:1s over the new person&rsquo;s first quarter. If the former person in that role has left Benchling, I can guarantee it almost never happens.</p>
<p>Because we don&rsquo;t talk much to or about alumni, it&rsquo;s common for someone in a role to know, in some sense, the least about what was done in the past.</p>

  An exercise in relitigating all the old battles
  <a class="anchor" href="#an-exercise-in-relitigating-all-the-old-battles">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The biggest problem with not looking at history is that we&rsquo;re doomed to repeat it. Given the same first principles information, reasonable people ask similar questions, and so it means, for example, we consider a question that we&rsquo;ve actually considered in the past.</p>
<p>That can be a good thing. For example, Benchling&rsquo;s investment in development use cases is something that was considered many years ago, and only recently came to fruition, when certain product investments were ready.</p>
<p>But in other cases, I see people going down the same road that their predecessor went down, with, basically, the same conclusion. And it&rsquo;s only after they reach the conclusion that they realize that, oh wait, Benchling as an institution has done this before.</p>
<p>This is most embarassing when a customer points it out (for some of our customers, they&rsquo;ve seen multiple PMs, AEs, and CX owners go by, ask the same questions, get the same answers, repeat ad nauseum).</p>
