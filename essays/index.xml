      <description>Organizational memory is very short # Median tenure at a tech company is about 2.5 years, and getting shorter. And while I think that&amp;rsquo;s generally good for employees, who can grow in their careers, compensation, and opportunities by switching roles frequently, it makes the companies themselves weaker.
The best people for the job # It took me a long time to realize that the smartest technologists, the people who really know what they&amp;rsquo;re doing, they don&amp;rsquo;t often write in a public facing way where other people can read it.</description>

      <description>Complexity is often irreducible unless you change the problem # We work in a pretty complex industry. Understanding a single customer, and every aspect of what they&amp;rsquo;re doing, is pretty hard. Extending it to lots of customers is even harder. Still, people try, but I see a logical error over and over again when they do so.
Make me a song # Let&amp;rsquo;s pick a different industry just to use as an analogy - music.</description>

      <description>This is an example page that shows me what Hugo Book can do # Columns # Columns help organize shorter pieces of content horizontally for readability.
{{&amp;lt; columns &amp;gt;}} &amp;lt;!-- begin columns block --&amp;gt; # Left Content Lorem markdownum insigne... &amp;lt;---&amp;gt; &amp;lt;!-- magic separator, between columns --&amp;gt; # Mid Content Lorem markdownum insigne... &amp;lt;---&amp;gt; &amp;lt;!-- magic separator, between columns --&amp;gt; # Right Content Lorem markdownum insigne... {{&amp;lt; /columns &amp;gt;}} Buttons # Buttons are styled links that can lead to local page or external link.</description>
