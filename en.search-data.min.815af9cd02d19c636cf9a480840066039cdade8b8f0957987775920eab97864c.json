[{"id":0,"href":"/about/","title":"About","section":"Introduction","content":" About this site # I\u0026rsquo;m nearing my 4 year anniversary at Benchling and, in the tradition of an undergraduate thesis at the end of college, I thought it\u0026rsquo;d be worth writing up all of my learnings in a place where others can read them.\nThe target audience for this is current Benchlings and ex-Benchlings, though there\u0026rsquo;s nothing company-sensitive or non-public on this site, obviously.\nWhat is your goal in writing this? # My only goal is to write down what I\u0026rsquo;ve learned in a place where others can see it. I don\u0026rsquo;t expect to win any Pulitzer\u0026rsquo;s. I don\u0026rsquo;t expect my writing here to have any effect (positive or negative) on my day job.\nWhat inspired you to do this? # This site is partly inspired by Steve Yegge, Joel Spolsky, and Dan Luu. All three of them are far better writers, programmers, and leaders than I am, so go read their blogs.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/essays/memory/","title":"Organizational memory is very short","section":"Essays","content":" Organizational memory is very short # "},{"id":2,"href":"/essays/","title":"Essays","section":"Introduction","content":""}]
