      <description>About this site # I&amp;rsquo;m nearing my 4 year anniversary at Benchling and, in the tradition of an undergraduate thesis at the end of college, I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be worth writing up all of my learnings in a place where others can read them.
The target audience for this is current Benchlings and ex-Benchlings, though there&amp;rsquo;s nothing company-sensitive or non-public on this site.
What is your goal in writing this?</description>

      <description>Organizational memory is very short # Median tenure at a tech company is about 2.5 years, and getting shorter. And while I think that&amp;rsquo;s generally good for employees, who can grow in their careers, compensation, and opportunities by switching roles frequently, it makes the companies themselves weaker.
The best people for the job # It took me a long time to realize that the smartest technologists, the people who really know what they&amp;rsquo;re doing, they don&amp;rsquo;t often write in a public facing way where other people can read it.</description>

      <description>Complexity is often irreducible unless you change the problem # We work in a pretty complex industry. Understanding a single customer, and every aspect of what they&amp;rsquo;re doing, is pretty hard. Extending it to lots of customers is even harder. Still, people try, but I see a logical error over and over again when they do so.
Make me a song # Let&amp;rsquo;s pick a different industry just to use as an analogy - music.</description>

      <description>This is an example page that shows me what Hugo Book can do # Columns # Columns help organize shorter pieces of content horizontally for readability.
{{&amp;lt; columns &amp;gt;}} &amp;lt;!-- begin columns block --&amp;gt; # Left Content Lorem markdownum insigne... &amp;lt;---&amp;gt; &amp;lt;!-- magic separator, between columns --&amp;gt; # Mid Content Lorem markdownum insigne... &amp;lt;---&amp;gt; &amp;lt;!-- magic separator, between columns --&amp;gt; # Right Content Lorem markdownum insigne... {{&amp;lt; /columns &amp;gt;}} Buttons # Buttons are styled links that can lead to local page or external link.</description>

      <description>Sanjay&amp;rsquo;s Draft Area # Welcome to the secret part of my site. See below for potential topics I may write about (whether I write about them or not depends on a combination of your feedback, how motivated I feel, how easy they are to write about, and the weather, among other things).
General tech # Integrations between software systems Messaging loses subtlety going up and down hierarchies The point of highest leverage is the customer story Can operations speed you up?</description>
