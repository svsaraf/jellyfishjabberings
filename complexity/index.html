<p>We work in a pretty complex industry. Understanding a single customer, and every aspect of what they&rsquo;re doing, is pretty hard. Extending it to lots of customers is even harder. Still, people try, but I see a logical error over and over again when they do so.</p>

</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s pick a different industry just to use as an analogy - music.</p>
<p>If I were to analyze all popular songs written in the last 50 years, I&rsquo;d notice a few significant trends.</p>
<p>One famous trend is that all pop songs use &ldquo;the same chords&rdquo;. To a first approximation, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Most pop choruses will involve the same set of dominant, minor sixth, prefect fourth, and perfect fifth chords, because that&rsquo;s what sounds good to a (mostly American) ear.</p>
<p>A naive person might think, &ldquo;okay, since most pop songs have four chords, I&rsquo;m going to make software that helps people write songs. Here&rsquo;s how it works - we give you a list of chords. You pick one, and it suggests the next chords you probably want, and in the end the song is written!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, one problem is Jimmy will get laughed out of the room.</p>
<p>Music isn&rsquo;t made that way. For one, if you were reading carefully above, we described our chord trend as an <em>approximation</em>. That&rsquo;s because any particular pop song has all sorts of extra stuff, like diminished 7ths to make the transition to the perfect fifth sound better, or a bridge that uses a minor second, or a key change at the emotional climax of the song.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just in the chords! Even the most generic pop song is really complicated - it has the drums coming in on a certain beat, and the bass line fades in a very particular way at 59 seconds in, and it has harmonies by Rihanna over the top, and it&rsquo;s mastered so that the various sounds in the track are balanced.</p>
<p>Once you understand all the complexity that goes into making music, you wonder: How could anyone incorporate all of this just to make a 3 minute track?</p>
<p>But however they do it, if you want them to use your software, they&rsquo;ll want to have much of the control and flexbility that they had in whatever they were using before.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re recording music using a gramaphone, you&rsquo;re not &ldquo;just choosing chords&rdquo;. You get a lot of control over the individual notes played, how loud they are, how much vibrato you use, etc. And so any software you build for &ldquo;making a pop song with Microsoft Clippy&rdquo; has to emulate that complexity - it has to let the user do all of the things the care about from the old process in the new one.</p>
<p>Of course, your software doesn&rsquo;t have to do absolutely everything. It used to be super annoying to loop tracks manually, until digital loopers were invented. Most pop artists can now lay in a simple beat via a digital trapset, rather than needing to hire a drummer to record one. So software <em>can</em> help make things better.</p>
<p>But the end goal, what the artist is trying to do, that&rsquo;s often as complex (or more complex) than what they used to make. Yes, even for the pop songs.</p>
<p>Your job is to make that easier, but you don&rsquo;t get to change what <em>they&rsquo;re</em> making, you have to change what <em>you&rsquo;re</em> making.</p>
<h2 id="changing-the-problem">
  Changing the problem
  <a class="anchor" href="#changing-the-problem">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The most common behavior I see is <em>saying</em> that you&rsquo;re solving the problem of making a pop song, but the problem you&rsquo;re actually solving is <em>a tool for smushing a bunch of reasonable sounding chords together</em>. Those are not the same problem!</p>
<p>They are similar in some sense, but there&rsquo;s a bunch of steps between one and the other, and no one bothers to talk about those steps. And yet, when asked about some of the subtlety and complexity that hasn&rsquo;t been addressed yet, I receive the same bromides about how most songs just have four chords. I know that! Everyone knows that!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reminded of the trope about how to draw an owl, which starts with two circles, and then instructs the student to &ldquo;draw the rest of the owl&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Basically every problem that anyone tries to solve has an 80 / 20 where the 80 looks relatively simple and straightforward and extendable. 80% of companies in this category do X. 80% of configurations look like Y. 80% of analyses look like Z.</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t look at the ever-present 80 / 20 and then draw the conclusion that the 20 is unnecessary or unimportant because it&rsquo;s possible you&rsquo;ve taken a path down the first 80% that is unrecoverable. You might be in a dead-end and unable to satisfy the other 20% of requirements.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll have built the software equivalent of a toilet that only lets you expel 80% of a bowel movement. The number of people using it won&rsquo;t be 80%&hellip;it&rsquo;ll be 0%.</p>
<h2 id="pick-something-smaller">
  Pick something smaller
  <a class="anchor" href="#pick-something-smaller">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The key is to understand exactly what the 80 / 20 refers to. Is it that 80% of customers have one piece of the puzzle that looks the same? That&rsquo;s nothing - those are everywhere.</p>
<p>What you want is to find 80% of <em>instances</em> of a problem that are solved end-to-end with the same, simple solution.</p>
<p>To take our music example, instead of solving the problem of &ldquo;make a pop song&rdquo;, our problem could instead be &ldquo;let me select multiple tracks and layer them over each other&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s a very specific problem that most but not all artists have and it&rsquo;s theoretically a simple software solution.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a way less <em>sexy</em> problem, though. The addressable market is smaller, and the amount we can charge customers is probably less. But we&rsquo;d have some confidence in solving something end-to-end.</p>
<p>Meanwhile our chord smusher basically solved no problem by itself. It&rsquo;s not even on the path to solving something end-to-end.</p>
<p>I think in most cases, leaders at our organization (and most others) would be best served by picking <em>less</em> ambitious problems. Not because we shouldn&rsquo;t try to do hard things, but because the ambition of the problem can mask a gap in structured thinking about the solution. We&rsquo;d be better served by focusing on tractable, specific things we can solve, rather than intractable, wide-ranging, longer timespan projects where we can get to 80% soon-ish, with the rest undefined and many years away.</p>
<h2 id="make-a-better-widget-connect-it-to-the-rest-of-the-machine">
  Make a better widget, connect it to the rest of the machine
  <a class="anchor" href="#make-a-better-widget-connect-it-to-the-rest-of-the-machine">#</a>
</h2>
<p>There are ways of taking your unsexy thing and making it better without overselling. For example, if your solution solves a critical sub-problem but isn&rsquo;t end-to-end alone, let the customer use an escape hatch to solve the rest of it in another tool. If they get end-to-end faster, you win, even if they are using your competitor to get the last mile done.</p>
<p>The main gap I see from decision-makers is not ignorance of the logic above, but the hesitation to apply it. It&rsquo;s <em>hard</em> to acknowledge that your product will only get the customer part of the way.</p>
<p>Most internal company incentives are to talk about the ideal. And because decision-makers don&rsquo;t always have  visibility into why we&rsquo;re doing the things we&rsquo;re doing, it&rsquo;s your job to distinguish between the bad 80% problem (80% of lots of things but 100% of nothing) and the good 80% (100% of a small problem end to end), and make sure you&rsquo;re working on the latter.</p>
<p>If you just sell the most interesting problem everywhere, it might work for a while, but in 9 or 12 months people are going to realize that your thing didn&rsquo;t actually create value for customers. Steering into transparency about problem complexity, and the (initial) inadequacy of the solution you&rsquo;re hoping to build, will allow real decisions about the value you&rsquo;re creating.</p>
