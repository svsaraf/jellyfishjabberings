I don\u0026rsquo;t expect to win any Pulitzer\u0026rsquo;s. I don\u0026rsquo;t expect my writing here to have any effect (positive or negative) on my day job on the Benchling product team.\nWhat inspired you to do this? # This site is partly inspired by Steve Yegge, Joel Spolsky, and Dan Luu. All three of them are far better writers than I am, so go read their blogs.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also done a few talks, and it\u0026rsquo;s been fun to share learnings with newer folks in this industry (and see whether veterans agree or disagree with me). So this is in some ways a descendent of more traditional internal talks I give like \u0026ldquo;Life of an Experiment\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;What is a Study?\u0026rdquo; and external talks like \u0026ldquo;Machine Learning for R\u0026amp;D\u0026rdquo;.\nDisclaimer: The opinions expressed on this blog are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of their employer or any organization with which they are affiliated.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/memory/","title":"Organizational memory is very short","section":"Essays","content":" Organizational memory is very short # Median tenure at a tech company is about 2.5 years, and getting shorter. And while I think that\u0026rsquo;s generally good for employees, who can grow in their careers, compensation, and opportunities by switching roles frequently, it makes the companies themselves weaker.\nThe best people for the job # It took me a long time to realize that the smartest technologists, the people who really know what they\u0026rsquo;re doing, they don\u0026rsquo;t often write in a public facing way where other people can read it. Some of them might\u0026hellip;but most don\u0026rsquo;t.\nAnd that means that most of the knowledge about what a job is, or how to do a job well, it\u0026rsquo;s not being written down anywhere that you can see it from the outside. I can name, off the top of my head, the best 20 software engineers I\u0026rsquo;ve worked with. None of them have a significant public facing web presence, and while I\u0026rsquo;m sure a few have random blogs floating around in the corner of the internet, I haven\u0026rsquo;t read their stuff, and no one else has either.\nInstead the people writing the articles about how to do the job are, often, people not actually doing the job anymore. The best books about how to be a PM are people who used to be PMs, but the best job description for them now is \u0026ldquo;book promotor\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;author\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;sales person\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;consultant\u0026rdquo;.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong - they write great books. And I\u0026rsquo;d be the first one to recommend Lean Startup or Cracking the PM Interview or any of the other 100 books in that genre. They\u0026rsquo;re great summaries of general concepts. But I don\u0026rsquo;t have much evidence that the writers were actually good PMs, vs just being in the right place at the right time. Are the people who write about the thing actually good at doing the thing? Or just good writers who have the credibility and knowledge to sell books?\nIt\u0026rsquo;s easier with jobs where publicity correlates to being good at your job. Good CEOs are selling their company to employees, investors, and customers. So if you\u0026rsquo;ve heard of a CEO, if they write something you respect, if you listen to them on a podcast, they\u0026rsquo;re actually showing themselves as being good at (at least part of) the job they have.\nBut engineers, PMs, designers, customer-facing team members, etc are roles where the best people are not necessarily the best at being public-facing. Indeed, many of them might see writing as, at best, a distraction.\nInternal documentation # So you would think that instead of writing things down externally, talented technologists would write things down internally. Like in a wiki, or in a series of github PRs, or in onboarding documentation that everyone needs to read. And they do.\nThe best people usually try to pass down their knowledge to newer employees, partly because it feels good to teach, but mostly because that knowledge was earned with blood and sweat and why not just tell people instead of forcing them to figure it out from first principles or re-experience the same pain?\nExcept, new employees don\u0026rsquo;t have time to read all the crap that was written down before they joined a company. Few people even bother to look. I certainly didn\u0026rsquo;t when I joined Benchling - there was 6 years of documents floating around and I did what any rational person would do: I hunted and pecked for what I thought was useful, and left the rest. I didn\u0026rsquo;t do that good of a job because I didn\u0026rsquo;t know what to look for.\nIt was only after I did a cursory search of a concept, like a vocabulary term a customer used once that sounded weird or interesting, that I would find reams of documents about it. Sometimes it was a really important concept!\nAnd then I would wonder to myself - am I the only idiot who didn\u0026rsquo;t know about all of this? And I would ask around, and the veterans agreed that they\u0026rsquo;ve known about the thing for a while, but there are fewer veterans around who remember that far back, because median tenure in this industry is so short. And even if tenure was better, people are people, they forget things. How much do you remember from 5 years ago?\nWe treat companies like these ships of theseuses, where we can replace the boards (rotten or not) and carry on sailing. But some of the boards actually had, written in people\u0026rsquo;s memories or in long forgotten documents and meeting recordings, all sorts of knowledge about sea monsters and where the buried treasure on that island once was.\nAnd we can\u0026rsquo;t go back and find it 1) because we don\u0026rsquo;t know which documents in our internal system are valuable and which ones were the equivalent of Plato\u0026rsquo;s allegory of the cave and 2) because the people who do know either are either busy or don\u0026rsquo;t remember or their slack is deactivated.\nWhy don\u0026rsquo;t people talk to their predecessors? # The most striking thing that I notice about this sort of missing knowledge is that people don\u0026rsquo;t really realize the things they don\u0026rsquo;t know. I think intellectually, they know that it is possible to have gaps, but pleading ignorance and going to someone else and asking them to fill you in, that\u0026rsquo;s sort of an embarrassing, humble thing to do, and I don\u0026rsquo;t see it as much as I\u0026rsquo;d like to. I am as guilty of this as anyone.\nFor example, let\u0026rsquo;s say you\u0026rsquo;re new in a job here. You would think that the first thing you would do is find the person who used to have that job, and ask them to give you as much knowledge as possible. Because there\u0026rsquo;s no way you would possibly know as much about this job as the person who just had it, right?\nBut apart for a few exceptional cases (for example, when someone moves from IC to manager and backfill hires the IC to replace them) this doesn\u0026rsquo;t really happen. If the former person moved to a different role at Benchling, context and knowledge share is limited to, at best, a couple of 1:1s over the new person\u0026rsquo;s first quarter. If the former person in that role has left Benchling, I can guarantee it almost never happens.\nBecause we don\u0026rsquo;t talk much to or about alumni, it\u0026rsquo;s common for someone in a role to know, in some sense, the least about what was done in the past compared to the median colleague who is watching from the sidelines.\nAn exercise in relitigating all the old battles # The biggest problem with not looking at history is that we\u0026rsquo;re doomed to repeat it. Given the same first principles information, reasonable people ask similar questions.\nThat can be a good thing. For example, Benchling\u0026rsquo;s investment in development is something that was considered many years ago, and only recently came to fruition. For pretty much every product we\u0026rsquo;ve developed, there is a long and sometimes sordid history of look-a-likes and imitations and prototypes and hackathon projects going back years.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s most embarassing when a customer points it out (for some of our customers, they\u0026rsquo;ve seen multiple PMs, AEs, and CX owners go by). We\u0026rsquo;ll have calls with a customer where we ask the same questions as someone did a year ago and get the same answers.\nIn essence, the only thing that\u0026rsquo;s new is who is asking the questions.\nWrite more? # I don\u0026rsquo;t think I have a tractable solution to this problem except to encourage people to write down more about the work they do in a place that other people can read it. Thus this essay (and all writings on this site).\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/complexity/","title":"Complexity is often irreducible","section":"Essays","content":" Complexity is often irreducible unless you change the problem # We work in a pretty complex industry. Understanding a single customer, and every aspect of what they\u0026rsquo;re doing, is pretty hard. Extending it to lots of customers is even harder. Still, people try, but I see a logical error over and over again when they do so.\nMake me a song # Let\u0026rsquo;s pick a different industry just to use as an analogy - music.\nIf I were to analyze all popular songs written in the last 50 years, I\u0026rsquo;d notice a few significant trends.\nOne famous trend is that all pop songs use \u0026ldquo;the same chords\u0026rdquo;. To a first approximation, that\u0026rsquo;s true.\nMost pop choruses will involve the same set of dominant, minor sixth, prefect fourth, and perfect fifth chords, because that\u0026rsquo;s what sounds good to a (mostly American) ear.\nA naive person might think, \u0026ldquo;okay, since most pop songs have four chords, I\u0026rsquo;m going to make software that helps people write songs. Here\u0026rsquo;s how it works - we give you a list of chords. You pick one, and it suggests the next chords you probably want, and in the end the song is written!\u0026rdquo;\nWell, one problem is Jimmy will get laughed out of the room.\nMusic isn\u0026rsquo;t made that way. For one, if you were reading carefully above, we described our chord trend as an approximation. That\u0026rsquo;s because any particular pop song has all sorts of extra stuff, like diminished 7ths to make the transition to the perfect fifth sound better, or a bridge that uses a minor second, or a key change at the emotional climax of the song.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s just in the chords! Even the most generic pop song is really complicated - it has the drums coming in on a certain beat, and the bass line fades in a very particular way at 59 seconds in, and it has harmonies by Rihanna over the top, and it\u0026rsquo;s mastered so that the various sounds in the track are balanced.\nOnce you understand all the complexity that goes into making music, you wonder: How could anyone incorporate all of this just to make a 3 minute track?\nBut however they do it, if you want them to use your software, they\u0026rsquo;ll want to have much of the control and flexbility that they had in whatever they were using before.\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;re recording music using a gramaphone, you\u0026rsquo;re not \u0026ldquo;just choosing chords\u0026rdquo;. You get a lot of control over the individual notes played, how loud they are, how much vibrato you use, etc. And so any software you build for \u0026ldquo;making a pop song with Microsoft Clippy\u0026rdquo; has to emulate that complexity - it has to let the user do all of the things the care about from the old process in the new one.\nOf course, your software doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to do absolutely everything. It used to be super annoying to loop tracks manually, until digital loopers were invented. Most pop artists can now lay in a simple beat via a digital trapset, rather than needing to hire a drummer to record one. So software can help make things better.\nBut the end goal, what the artist is trying to do, that\u0026rsquo;s often as complex (or more complex) than what they used to make. Yes, even for the pop songs.\nYour job is to make that easier, but you don\u0026rsquo;t get to change what they\u0026rsquo;re making, you have to change what you\u0026rsquo;re making.\nChanging the problem # The most common behavior I see is saying that you\u0026rsquo;re solving the problem of making a pop song, but the problem you\u0026rsquo;re actually solving is a tool for smushing a bunch of reasonable sounding chords together. Those are not the same problem!\nThey are similar in some sense, but there\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of steps between one and the other, and no one bothers to talk about those steps. And yet, when asked about some of the subtlety and complexity that hasn\u0026rsquo;t been addressed yet, I receive the same bromides about how most songs just have four chords. I know that! Everyone knows that!\nI\u0026rsquo;m reminded of the trope about how to draw an owl, which starts with two circles, and then instructs the student to \u0026ldquo;draw the rest of the owl\u0026rdquo;.\nBasically every problem that anyone tries to solve has an 80 / 20 where the 80 looks relatively simple and straightforward and extendable. 80% of companies in this category do X. 80% of configurations look like Y. 80% of analyses look like Z.\nBut you can\u0026rsquo;t look at the ever-present 80 / 20 and then draw the conclusion that the 20 is unnecessary or unimportant because it\u0026rsquo;s possible you\u0026rsquo;ve taken a path down the first 80% that is unrecoverable. You might be in a dead-end and unable to satisfy the other 20% of requirements.\nAnd you\u0026rsquo;ll have built the software equivalent of a toilet that only lets you expel 80% of a bowel movement. The number of people using it won\u0026rsquo;t be 80%\u0026hellip;it\u0026rsquo;ll be 0%.\nPick something smaller # The key is to understand exactly what the 80 / 20 refers to. Is it that 80% of customers have one piece of the puzzle that looks the same? That\u0026rsquo;s nothing - those are everywhere.\nWhat you want is to find 80% of instances of a problem that are solved end-to-end with the same, simple solution.\nTo take our music example, instead of solving the problem of \u0026ldquo;make a pop song\u0026rdquo;, our problem could instead be \u0026ldquo;let me select multiple tracks and layer them over each other\u0026rdquo;. That\u0026rsquo;s a very specific problem that most but not all artists have and it\u0026rsquo;s theoretically a simple software solution.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a way less sexy problem, though. The addressable market is smaller, and the amount we can charge customers is probably less. But we\u0026rsquo;d have some confidence in solving something end-to-end.\nMeanwhile our chord smusher basically solved no problem by itself. It\u0026rsquo;s not even on the path to solving something end-to-end.\nI think in most cases, leaders at our organization (and most others) would be best served by picking less ambitious problems. Not because we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t try to do hard things, but because the ambition of the problem can mask a gap in structured thinking about the solution. We\u0026rsquo;d be better served by focusing on tractable, specific things we can solve, rather than intractable, wide-ranging, longer timespan projects where we can get to 80% soon-ish, with the rest undefined and many years away.\nMake a better widget, connect it to the rest of the machine # There are ways of taking your unsexy thing and making it better without overselling. For example, if your solution solves a critical sub-problem but isn\u0026rsquo;t end-to-end alone, let the customer use an escape hatch to solve the rest of it in another tool. If they get end-to-end faster, you win, even if they are using your competitor to get the last mile done.\nThe main gap I see from decision-makers is not ignorance of the logic above, but the hesitation to apply it. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to acknowledge that your product will only get the customer part of the way.\nMost internal company incentives are to talk about the ideal. And because decision-makers don\u0026rsquo;t always have visibility into why we\u0026rsquo;re doing the things we\u0026rsquo;re doing, it\u0026rsquo;s your job to distinguish between the bad 80% problem (80% of lots of things but 100% of nothing) and the good 80% (100% of a small problem end to end), and make sure you\u0026rsquo;re working on the latter.\nIf you just sell the most interesting problem everywhere, it might work for a while, but in 9 or 12 months people are going to realize that your thing didn\u0026rsquo;t actually create value for customers. Steering into transparency about problem complexity, and the (initial) inadequacy of the solution you\u0026rsquo;re hoping to build, will allow real decisions about the value you\u0026rsquo;re creating.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/essays/","title":"Essays","section":"Jellyfish Jabberings","content":""}]
